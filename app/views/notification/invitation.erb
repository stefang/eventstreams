Hi you wonderful guinea pig - sorry 'alpha tester'!

Thanks for helping us out with the alpha testing of Eventstreams.  More to the point thanks up front for putting up with the inevitable quirks, eccentricities and bugs. This is a very early version, running on a fragile server and the app is 100% UNTESTED on IE :)

Any and all feedback will be gratefully received and will help improve the product (if not Stefan's sleep pattern.)

So with that said, if you have any thoughts about how Eventstreams could improve do not hesitate to contact me by email: mjukes@gmail.com or use the 'Support' tag throughout the site and add your thoughts to Zendesk

ps. if you have a problem please don't reply to me, I'm just a robot!
